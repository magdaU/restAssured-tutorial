## 🎮 Video Game API

Tested API: **Video Game DB** – a simple, fictional video game database.

- Swagger UI: https://videogamedb.uk/swagger-ui/index.html
- Base URL: `https://videogamedb.uk/api/v2/`

> ⚠️ The API runs in **read-only mode** – create, update, and delete operations are not persisted.

### Endpoints

| Constant               | Path                         | Description                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `ALL_VIDEO_GAMES`      | `/videogame`                 | List all video games          |
| `SINGLE_VIDEO_GAME`    | `/videogame/{videoGameId}`   | Get details of a single game  |

### Tests (`VideoGameTests`)

- `getAllGames` – retrieve all games
- `createNewGameByJSON` – create a game via JSON body
- `createNewGameByXML` – create a game via XML body
- `updateGame` – update a game (PUT)
- `deleteGame` – delete a game (DELETE)
- `getSingleGame` – retrieve a single game by ID
- `testVideoGameSerializationJSON` – serialize a POJO object to JSON
- `testVideoGameSerializationXML` – validate XML response against XSD (`VideoGameXSD.xsd`)
- `testVideoGameSchemaJSON` – validate response against JSON Schema (`VideoGameJsonSchema.json`)
- `convertJsonToPojo` – deserialize response into a `VideoGame` object
- `catureResponseTime` – capture and print response time in milliseconds
- `assertOnResponseTime` – assert response time is under 1000 ms
- `getAllGamesVerifyListNotEmpty` – assert the returned game list is not empty
- `getSingleGameVerifyFields` – assert `id`, `name` and `category` fields on a single game response

---

## ⚽ Football API

Tested API: **football-data.org** – football competition data.

- Documentation: https://www.football-data.org/
- Base URL: `https://api.football-data.org/v4/`

### Authentication – API token required

Football tests require an API token from [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/).  
Without a token, tests will be automatically skipped (`Assume`).

Provide the token in one of two ways:

**Environment variable (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:FOOTBALL_DATA_API_TOKEN="your-token"
mvn -Dtest=FootbalTests test
```

**Maven/JVM property:**
```powershell
mvn -Dfootball.api.token="your-token" -Dtest=FootbalTests test
```

### Tests (`FootbalTests`)

- `getDetailsOneAre` – retrieve data for a single area
- `getDetailsOfMultipleArea` – retrieve data for multiple areas
- `getDataFounded` – verify a team's founding year
- `getFirstTeamName` – get the name of the first team in a league
- `getAllTeamData` – display full team data
- `getAllTeamData_DoCheckFirst` – extract response with status code validation
- `extractHeaders` – read response headers
- `extractHeadersTeamName` – extract team name via `jsonPath()`
- `extractAllTeams` – list all teams in a league
- `getCompetitions` – retrieve all competitions and assert list is not empty
- `getTopScorersForPremierLeague` – retrieve top scorers for Premier League (competition `2021`)
- `getStandingsForPremierLeague` – retrieve standings table for Premier League

---

## 🔍 GPath Tests

### GpathJSONTest (JSON)
Advanced querying of JSON responses using **GPath** (Groovy Path) syntax against the VideoGame API:

- `extractMapOfElementsWithFind` – find a game by name using `find { it.name == '...' }`
- `extractSingleValueWithFind` – find a game by ID using `find { it.id == 1 }`
- `extractListOfValueWithFindAll` – list games with `reviewScore > 70` using `findAll`
- `extractSingleValueWithHighestNumber` – game with the highest ID using `max { it.id }`
- `extractMutlipleValuesAndSumThem` – sum of all game IDs using `collect { it.id }.sum()`

### GpathXMLTests (XML)
Querying XML responses using **GPath** and **XmlPath** against the VideoGame API.

> XML response structure: `<List><item category="..."><id/><name/><releaseDate/><reviewScore/><rating/></item></List>`

- `getFirstGameInList` – name of the first game: `List.item[0].name`
- `getAttribute` – read the `category` attribute: `List.item[0].@category`
- `getListOfXMlNodes` – all game names as a list: `List.item.name`
- `getListOfXMLNodesByFindAllOnAttribute` – filter games by category: `findAll { it.@category == 'Shooter' }`
- `getSingleNode` – find a specific game by name: `find { it.name == 'Resident Evil 4' }`

### GPath tests only
```powershell
mvn -Dtest=GpathJSONTest test
mvn -Dtest=GpathXMLTests test
```

### All tests except Football (no token required)
```powershell
mvn "-Dtest=VideoGameTests,GpathJSONTest,GpathXMLTests,MyFirstVideoGame" test
```

### Football tests only (API token required)
```powershell
$env:FOOTBALL_DATA_API_TOKEN="your-token"
mvn -Dtest=FootbalTests test
```

> **Note:** Football tests require a free API token from [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/). Without a token all Football tests return HTTP 403.
